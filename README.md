# AWS DeepRacer control package

## Overview

The AWS DeepRacer control ROS package creates the `ctrl_node`, which is part of the core AWS DeepRacer application and launches from the `deepracer_launcher`. More details about the application and the components can be found in the  [`aws-deepracer-launcher` repository](https://github.com/aws-deepracer/aws-deepracer-launcher).

This is a main node with services exposed to be used by webserver backend API calls. This node manages the device's different modes [manual, autonomous, calibration]. It allows us to maintain the device in a single mode at any point of time so that the overlapping functionalities (such as servo messages) do not conflict with each other. Also, this can be extended to add more modes, as in the [Follow the Leader (FTL) sample project](https://github.com/aws-deepracer/aws-deepracer-follow-the-leader-sample-project).

## License

The source code is released under Apache 2.0 (https://aws.amazon.com/apache-2-0/).

## Installation
Follow these steps to install the AWS DeepRacer control ROS package.

### Prerequisites

The AWS DeepRacer device comes with all the prerequisite packages and libraries installed to run the `ctrl_pkg`. For more information about the pre-installed set of packages and libraries on the AWS DeepRacer, and about installing the required build systems, see [Getting started with AWS DeepRacer OpenSource](https://github.com/aws-deepracer/aws-deepracer-launcher/blob/main/getting-started.md).

The `ctrl_pkg` specifically depends on the following ROS 2 packages as build and execute dependencies:

1. `deepracer_interfaces_pkg`: This packages contains the custom message and service type definitions used across the AWS DeepRacer core application.
1. `camera_pkg`: The AWS DeepRacer camera ROS package creates the `camera_node`, which is part of the core AWS DeepRacer application.
1. `servo_pkg`: The AWS DeepRacer servo ROS package creates the `servo_node`, which is part of the core AWS DeepRacer application.
1. `inference_pkg`: The AWS DeepRacer inference ROS package creates the `inference_node`, which is part of the core AWS DeepRacer application.
1. `model_optimizer_pkg`: The AWS DeepRacer model optimizer ROS package creates the `model_optimizer_node`, which is part of the core AWS DeepRacer application.
1. `deepracer_navigation_pkg`: The AWS DeepRacer navigation ROS package creates the `deepracer_navigation_node`, which is part of the core AWS DeepRacer application.

## Downloading and building

Open a terminal on the AWS DeepRacer device and run the following commands as the root user.

1. Switch to the root user before you source the ROS 2 installation:

        sudo su

1. Source the ROS 2 Foxy setup bash script:

        source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash 

1. Set the environment variables required to run Intel OpenVino scripts:

        source /opt/intel/openvino_2021/bin/setupvars.sh

1. Create a workspace directory for the package:

        mkdir -p ~/deepracer_ws
        cd ~/deepracer_ws

1. Clone the `ctrl_pkg` on the AWS DeepRacer device:

        git clone https://github.com/aws-deepracer/aws-deepracer-ctrl-pkg.git

1. Fetch unreleased dependencies:

        cd ~/deepracer_ws/aws-deepracer-ctrl-pkg
        rosws update

1. Resolve the `ctrl_pkg` dependencies:

        cd ~/deepracer_ws/aws-deepracer-ctrl-pkg && apt-get update
        rosdep install -i --from-path . --rosdistro foxy -y

1. Build the `ctrl_pkg`, `camera_pkg`, `servo_pkg`, `inference_pkg`, `model_optimizer_pkg`, `deepracer_navigation_pkg`, and `deepracer_interfaces_pkg`:

        cd ~/deepracer_ws/aws-deepracer-ctrl-pkg && colcon build --packages-select ctrl_pkg camera_pkg servo_pkg inference_pkg model_optimizer_pkg deepracer_navigation_pkg deepracer_interfaces_pkg

## Usage

The `ctrl_node` provides basic system-level functionality for the AWS DeepRacer application to work. Although the node is built to work with the AWS DeepRacer application, it can be run independently for development, testing, and debugging purposes.

### Run the node

To launch the built `ctrl_node` as the root user on the AWS DeepRacer device, open another terminal on the AWS DeepRacer device and run the following commands as the root user:

1. Switch to the root user before you source the ROS 2 installation:

        sudo su

1. Source the ROS 2 Foxy setup bash script:

        source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash 

1. Source the setup script for the installed packages:

        source ~/deepracer_ws/aws-deepracer-ctrl-pkg/install/setup.bash  

1. Launch the `ctrl_node` using the launch script:

        ros2 launch ctrl_pkg ctrl_pkg_launch.py

## Launch files

The `ctrl_node` provides the core functionality to manage the device's different modes of operation. The `ctrl_pkg_launch.py` is also included in this package. It provides an example demonstrating how to launch the nodes independently from the core application.

        from launch import LaunchDescription
        from launch_ros.actions import Node

        def generate_launch_description():
            return LaunchDescription([
                Node(
                    package='ctrl_pkg',
                    namespace='ctrl_pkg',
                    executable='ctrl_node',
                    name='ctrl_node'
                )
            ])
